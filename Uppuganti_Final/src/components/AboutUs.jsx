                        The Tetas de Maria Guevara ("Maria Guevara's breasts"), located in a coastal plain in the south of the 1,670 hectare Laguna de La Restinga National Park,
                        are two small twin hills with a height of 135 metres (443 ft). The vegetation around the hills is desert, with cacti, prickly pears, yaks,
                        guamaches. The fauna is diverse, including desert lizards, rabbits, rattlesnakes and coral.</p>
                    <p>
                        The legend told by the inhabitants of the island goes that the name María Guevara comes from a white young girl who was
                        heavily involved in the War of Independence and that upon her death, the hills rose on her grave. Another Margaritan myth
                        says the source of the name also comes from the same woman, but that she was from Cumaná and came to the island to lead a
                        group of men in fishing activities. As she had small breasts, by way of derision whenever they sighted the hills said,
                        "there are the lady's tits" and the name was created. The area was declared a national park on February 27, 1974. </p>
